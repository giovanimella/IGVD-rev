<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a wide array of features for their UniOzoxx LMS, including attendance tracking, sales onboarding, admin reports, and more. The project's focus then shifted significantly based on user feedback.

Key tasks accomplished and requested during the session:
1.  **AI-Powered Translation:** The user rejected a static i18n implementation and requested a real-time, on-the-fly translation system for all page content.
2.  **Company Events:** A system for admins to create company-wide appointments (events, meetings, campaigns) that appear on the agenda for all licensees.
3.  **Platform Rebranding & Deployment:** A complete rebranding of the platform to IGVD - Instituto Global de Vendas Diretas and a request for a comprehensive guide and scripts to deploy the entire application on the user's own Ubuntu server.
4.  **Live Deployment Debugging:** The user encountered numerous issues while deploying to their server, requiring the agent to provide step-by-step debugging for Nginx, Python environment, database connections, frontend build processes, and application logic errors.
5.  **Live Dashboard Stats:** The user wanted the mocked statistics on the admin dashboard to be replaced with real data pulled from the database.
6.  **PWA Functionality:** The user requested to make the site installable as a Progressive Web App on mobile devices.
7.  **Bug Fix (Latest):** The user reported that the licensee dashboard page goes blank after loading.

**User's preferred language**: Português

**what currently exists?**
The application is a full-stack LMS (React/FastAPI/MongoDB). A significant amount of work has been done to move the application from a development environment to the user's self-hosted production server.
- **Features**: A real-time AI translation system is in place. A company-wide event management system is functional. The admin dashboard now displays live statistics. The application is configured as a PWA.
- **Deployment**: A complete set of deployment scripts (, , ), Nginx configuration, and a detailed installation guide () have been created and are located in the  directory.
- **State**: The application is live on the user's domain () but is undergoing final debugging. Recent fixes have resolved login issues, database schema mismatches, and web server configuration problems.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working on**: Debugging a critical frontend bug where the licensee dashboard () turns into a white screen after loading. The agent identified a Javascript error in the browser console:  in  related to the  state variable.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: manual testing by curl. Since the application is on the user's server, the agent cannot use automated testing tools. The agent must provide the code fix to the user and instruct them on how to apply it (), rebuild the frontend (yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.), and verify the result.
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Licensee Dashboard is Blank (P0)**
  - **Description**: When a user with the 'licenciado' role logs in, the dashboard page loads for a moment and then becomes a blank white screen. The browser console shows a  because the code tries to read the  property of the  state, which is  when the API call to fetch data fails or returns no data.
  - **Attempted fixes**: The agent identified the root cause and the specific line of code. The proposed fix is to change the initial state of  from  to an empty array .
  - **Next debug checklist**:
    1.  Edit .
    2.  Locate the line .
    3.  Change it to .
    4.  Instruct the user to pull the change from GitHub, rebuild the frontend on their server, and test again.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: This is a critical bug as it makes the main page unusable for the primary user role of the platform.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?**: N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None

- **Issue 2: File Uploads Failing System-Wide (P1)**
  - **Description**: The user reported that all file upload functionalities (logo, user documents, file repository) are failing on the production server. The agent diagnosed this as a permissions issue and a potential hardcoded directory path () which is incorrect for the user's server structure ().
  - **Attempted fixes**: The agent provided commands to create the correct directories on the user's server and set the appropriate  permissions. The agent also asked the user to  for the hardcoded path but has not received a response on that yet.
  - **Next debug checklist**:
    1.  Confirm with the user if the  command returned any results.
    2.  If hardcoded paths are found, systematically replace them in the backend code to use a correct, relative, or environment-configured path. A good solution would be to define a  in the  file.
    3.  If no hardcoded paths are found, the permission fixes should have worked. Ask the user to re-test an upload.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Core features like user onboarding and admin customization are blocked.
  - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?**: N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Both
  - **Blocked on other issue**: None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Future Tasks:**
  - **Task 1: Implement Payment Gateway (P1):** Integrate a payment gateway like PagSeguro or MercadoPago for the sales stage.
  - **Task 2: Automated Reminders (P2):** Implement automated email or platform notifications for training classes.
  - **Task 3: Comprehensive Feature Testing (P1):** Once the deployment is stable, conduct a full regression test of all platform features.

**Completed work in this session**
- **AI-Powered Translation System**: Implemented a real-time translation feature using Claude Sonnet 4.5 via Emergent LLM Key.
- **Company-Wide Events System**: Built a full CRUD feature for admins to manage events visible on all licensee agendas.
- **Full Platform Rebranding to IGVD**: Renamed the platform across the entire codebase and database from UniOzoxx to IGVD - Instituto Global de Vendas Diretas.
- **Live Dashboard Statistics**: Replaced hardcoded chart data on the Admin Dashboard with two new backend endpoints (, ) that query the database for real-time analytics.
- **PWA (Progressive Web App) Activation**: Created and configured  and a  to make the application installable on mobile devices.
- **Deployment Guide & Scripts**: Created a  directory containing a detailed  guide,  script, Nginx config, and other utility scripts for deploying on Ubuntu.
- **Extensive Live Deployment Debugging**: Interactively troubleshooted and resolved numerous production server issues with the user, including Python version conflicts, Node.js memory errors, database authentication, schema mismatches, Nginx configuration, and SSL setup.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Theming:** React Context + TailwindCSS .
- **AI-powered Translation:** Backend endpoint using  (Claude Sonnet 4.5) to translate text. Frontend uses a  in a React Context to capture and replace DOM text content on the fly.
- **Deployment:** The application is now self-hosted by the user on an Ubuntu server using Nginx as a reverse proxy, Gunicorn/Uvicorn for the FastAPI backend, and Let's Encrypt for SSL. Systemd services manage the processes.
- **PWA:** A  and a basic caching  have been added to make the site installable.

**key DB schema**
- **users**: The  field was renamed to . , , and  were added to fix a validation error.
- **company_events (new collection)**: Stores global events created by admins. .
- **stats_history (new collection)**: Used to track historical data for generating charts.

**changes in tech stack**
-  was added to the backend for date calculations in statistics.

**All files of reference**
- : Location of the current critical bug. Was heavily modified to fetch live stats.

0) Sair: The main installation script for the user's server. Was updated multiple times to handle environment-specific errors.
- : The user manual for deployment.
- : Contains the new logic for the dashboard charts.
- : The complex real-time translation logic.
- : Contains logic for fetching both user and company events.
- : The service worker file. Was recently fixed to prevent caching invalid requests.
- : Contains the  logic for page authorization.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The file upload logic across the backend likely contains hardcoded paths () and should be refactored to use a single, configurable path from an environment variable.

**key api endpoints**
- : Translates a batch of text.
- : (Admin) Get all company events. (Also CRUD endpoints).
- : (Licensee) Gets user appointments and now also includes company events.
- : Provides data for the admin dashboard growth chart.
- : Provides data for the admin dashboard distribution chart.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **You are in a support/debugging role.** The user is managing their own production server. Your primary job is to help them fix issues on their live instance.
- **You CANNOT run tests directly.** Provide the user with code changes and clear, step-by-step instructions for them to apply the fixes (e.g., , edit file, run build, restart service).
- **Prioritize Stability:** The user's live system is partially broken. Focus on fixing the  and  issues before proposing new features.
- **Context is Key:** The user's environment is Ubuntu (latest), running Nginx, Python 3.12+, and MongoDB. Keep this in mind for all commands and code you provide.
